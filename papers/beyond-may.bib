  abstract      = {Networks studied in many disciplines, including neuroscience and mathematical biology, have connectivity that may be stochastic about some underlying mean connectivity represented by a non-normal matrix. Furthermore, the stochasticity may not be independent and identically distributed (iid) across elements of the connectivity matrix. More generally, the problem of understanding the behavior of stochastic matrices with nontrivial mean structure and correlations arises in many settings. We address this by characterizing large random N\texttimes N matrices of the form A=M+LJR, where M,L, and R are arbitrary deterministic matrices and J is a random matrix of zero-mean iid elements. M can be non-normal, and L and R allow correlations that have separable dependence on row and column indices. We first provide a general formula for the eigenvalue density of A. For A non-normal, the eigenvalues do not suffice to specify the dynamics induced by A, so we also provide general formulas for the transient evolution of the magnitude of activity and frequency power spectrum in an N-dimensional linear dynamical system with a coupling matrix given by A. These quantities can also be thought of as characterizing the stability and the magnitude of the linear response of a nonlinear network to small perturbations about a fixed point. We derive these formulas and work them out analytically for some examples of M,L, and R motivated by neurobiological models. We also argue that the persistence as N\textrightarrow{} of a finite number of randomly distributed outlying eigenvalues outside the support of the eigenvalue density of A, as previously observed, arises in regions of the complex plane {$\Omega$} where there are nonzero singular values of L-1(z1-M)R-1 (for z{$\Omega$}) that vanish as N\textrightarrow. When such singular values do not exist and L and R are equal to the identity, there is a correspondence in the normalized Frobenius norm (but not in the operator norm) between the support of the spectrum of A for J of norm {$\sigma$} and the {$\sigma$} pseudospectrum of M.},

  abstract  = {The stability of complex ecological networks depends both on the interactions between species and the direct effects of the species on themselves. These self-effects are known as 'self-regulation' when an increase in a species' abundance decreases its per-capita growth rate. Sources of self-regulation include intraspecific interference, cannibalism, time-scale separation between consumers and their resources, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear functional responses coupling predators with their prey. The influence of self-regulation on network stability is understudied and in addition, the empirical estimation of self-effects poses a formidable challenge. Here, we show that empirical food web structures cannot be stabilized unless the majority of species exhibit substantially strong self-regulation. We also derive an analytical formula predicting the effect of self-regulation on network stability with high accuracy and show that even for random networks, as well as networks with a cascade structure, stability requires negative self-effects for a large proportion of species. These results suggest that the aforementioned potential mechanisms of self-regulation are probably more important in contributing to the stability of observed ecological networks than was previously thought.},

  abstract  = {Predation often deviates from the law of mass action: many micro- and meso-scale experiments have shown that consumption saturates with resource abundance, and decreases due to interference between consumers. But does this observation hold at macro-ecological scales, spanning many species and orders of magnitude in biomass? If so, what are its consequences for large-scale ecological patterns and dynamics?. We perform a meta-analysis of predator\textendash prey pairs of mammals, birds and reptiles, and show that total predation rates appear to increase, not as the product of predator and prey densities following the Lotka\textendash Volterra (mass action) model, but rather as the square root of that product. This suggests a phenomenological power-law expression of the effective cross-ecosystem predation rate. We discuss whether the same power-law may hold dynamically within an ecosystem, and assuming that it does, we explore its consequences in a simple food chain model. The empirical exponents fall close to the boundary between regimes of donor and consumer limitation. Exponents on this boundary are singular in multiple ways. First, they maximize predator abundance and some stability metrics. Second, they create proportionality relations between biomass and productivity, both within and between trophic levels. These intuitive relations do not hold in general in mass action models, yet they are widely observed empirically. These results provide evidence of mechanisms limiting predation across multiple ecological scales. Some of this evidence was previously associated with donor control, but we show that it supports a wider range of possibilities, including forms of consumer control. As limiting consumption counter-intuitively allows larger populations, it is worthwhile to reconsider whether the observed predation rates arise from microscopic mechanisms, or could hint at selective pressure at the population level.},

Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system's response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system's dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system's dynamics.},

Our model incorporates individual memory of exposure to a contagious entity (e.g. a rumor or disease), variable magnitudes of exposure (dose sizes), and heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals. Through analysis and simulation, we examine in detail the case where individuals may recover from an infection and then immediately become susceptible again (analogous to the so-called SIS model). We identify three basic classes of contagion models which we call epidemic threshold, vanishing critical mass, and critical mass classes, where each class of models corresponds to different strategies for prevention or facilitation. We find that the conditions for a particular contagion model to belong to one of the these three classes depend only on memory length and the probabilities of being infected by one and two exposures, respectively. These parameters are in principle measurable for real contagious influences or entities, thus yielding empirical implications for our model. We also study the case where individuals attain permanent immunity once recovered, finding that epidemics inevitably die out but may be surprisingly persistent when individuals possess memory.},

  abstract = {A central assumption in most ecological models is that the interactions in a community operate only between pairs of species. However, two species may interactively affect the growth of a focal species. Although interactions among three or more species, called higher-order interactions, have the potential to modify our theoretical understanding of coexistence, ecologists lack clear expectations for how these interactions shape community structure. Here we analytically predict and numerically confirm how the variability and strength of higher-order interactions affect species coexistence. We found that as higher-order interaction strengths became more variable across species, fewer species could coexist, echoing the behavior of pairwise models. If interspecific higher-order interactions became too harmful relative to self-regulation, coexistence in diverse communities was destabilized, but coexistence was also lost when these interactions were too weak and mutualistic higher-order effects became prevalent. This behavior depended on the functional form of the interactions as the destabilizing effects of the mutualistic higher-order interactions were ameliorated when their strength saturated with species' densities. Last, we showed that more species-rich communities structured by higher-order interactions lose species more readily than their species-poor counterparts, generalizing classic results for community stability. Our work provides needed theoretical expectations for how higher-order interactions impact species coexistence in diverse communities.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities 1-5. On the other hand, neutral models 6-9 , in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance 10 , and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age 11 , contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions 12,13 , in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades 14-16 , their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear 5. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models. We studied deterministic models describing communities in which the number of individuals is large and the system is isolated (for example, bacterial strain competition in laboratory conditions 17); in Supplementary Information section S4 we examine the case in which the dynamics are stochastic, which best describe communities in which the number of individuals is finite. Finally, we allow new species to be introduced at a given rate, allowing for a comparison with neutral models (Supplementary Information section S5). Although our results hold for a wide class of systems, to exemplify our findings we consider the dynamics of a forest in which there is a fixed, large number of trees, so that we can simply track x i (t), the proportion of trees of species i at time t, with {$\sum$} i x i (t) = 1. At each step, a randomly selected tree dies, opening a gap in the canopy (that is, we initially assume identical per capita death rates for all species). This event ignites competition among seedlings to fill the gap. Suppose that all individuals produce the same number of seedlings, and that we pick two seedlings at random, with the winner of the competition filling the gap (Supplementary Fig. 1). The matrix H encodes the dominance relationships among the species: H ij is the probability that the first seedling, belonging to species i, wins against the second seedling, belonging to species j. Clearly, H ii = {$\frac{1}{2}$} for all i, and H ij + H ji = 1 for all i and j. If all H ij = {$\frac{1}{2}$}, we recover a neutral model. At the other extreme lies a model in which each pair (H ij , H ji) is either (1,0) or (0,1) (that is, species i always wins or always loses against j), in which case H is called a 'tournament matrix' 18. A number of results have been derived for this case 19 , showing that coexistence is possible when species form 'intransitive cycles' of competitive dominance, such as in the rock-paper-scissors game 20. Here we extend these previous findings 19 to the most general case in which interactions range from neutral to complete dominance. We can approximate the dynamics of the n species as (see Methods): {$\sum$} = - x t t x t H x t x t d () d ()2 () () (1) i i j ij j i Where - x i (t) models the death process, and x i (t)2H ij x j (t) is the probability of picking two seedlings of species i and j, with i winning the competition. The factor 2 arises from the fact that we could pick i first and j second, or vice versa, with the same outcome. Simple manipulations (Supplementary Information section S1) show that these equations are equivalent to the system: {$\sum$} = x t t x t P x t d () d () () (2) i i j ij j which is the celebrated replicator equation 21,22 for a zero-sum, symmetric matrix game with two players and payoffs encoded in the skew-symmetric matrix P = H - H t. This equation is at the core of evolutionary game theory, with applications spanning multiple fields 23,24. Thanks to this equivalence, we are able to characterize the dynamics. Unless specified, we assume H to be of full rank, that is, all of its eigenvalues are non-zero. We show in the Supplementary Information that violations of this assumption are unbiological, amounting to degenerate cases in which slightly altering the parameters dramatically changes the outcome. Suppose that we start with n species and initial conditions x i (0) {$>$} 0, and that we let the dynamics unfold. Once the transient dynamics have elapsed, we find k {$\leq$} n coexisting species, with k being odd. The n - k species that go extinct do so irrespective of initial conditions, and the k coexisting species cycle neutrally around a unique equilibrium point x* (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information section S1). How large is k when we build the matrix H at random? When drawing H ij (with i {$<$} j) from the uniform distribution U[0,1] and setting the corresponding H ji = 1 - H ij , we find that the probability of having k species coexisting when starting with n species, p(k| n) = 0 when k is even, and | = - () p k n () 2 n k n 1 when k is odd 25 (Supplementary Fig. 2). This matches what is found for tournament games 18,19,26 , in which dominance is complete: we expect half of the initial species to coexist, irrespective of the choice of n; moreover, monodominance is extremely rare, and about as rare as the coexistence of all species. Thus, this theory generates high biodiversity without the need to fine-tune parameters. This model can generate any species-abundance distribution: for any choice of x*, we can build infinitely many matrices H such that equations (1) and (2) have x* as an equilibrium (Supplementary Information section S1). We note that this is true irrespective of the fact that x* contains an even or odd number of species (Fig. 1)-but the case},

In this way, first we show that higher variability in link strengths stabilizes food webs only when webs are relatively small, whereas larger webs are instead destabilized. Second, we reveal a new power law describing how food-web stability scales with the number of species and their connectance. Third, we report two universal rules: Food-web stability is enhanced when (i) species at a high trophic level feed on multiple prey species and (ii) species at an intermediate trophic level are fed upon by multiple predator species.},

  abstract  = {The rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome demonstrated the potential threat an infectious disease poses in a closely interconnected and interdependent world. Here we introduce a probabilistic model that describes the worldwide spread of infectious diseases and demonstrate that a forecast of the geographical spread of epidemics is indeed possible. This model combines a stochastic local infection dynamics among individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network, taking into account national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance. The performance of different control strategies is analyzed, and our simulations show that a quick and focused reaction is essential to inhibiting the global spread of epidemics.},

Typically, the number of such constituents is high, but only limited data sources on them are available. Conventional dynamical models of complex systems are rarely mathematically tractable and their numerical exploration suffers both from computational and data limitations. Here we review generalized modeling, an alternative approach for formulating dynamical models to gain insights into dynamics and bifurcations of uncertain systems. We argue that this approach deals elegantly with the uncertainties that exist in real world data and enables analytical insight or highly efficient numerical investigation. We provide a survey of recent successes of generalized modeling and a guide to the application of this modeling approach in future studies such as complex integrative ecological models.},

Tools such as random matrix theory and the study of large sample covariance matrices can efficiently process these big data sets and help make sense of modern, deep learning algorithms. Presenting an introductory calculus course for random matrices, the book focusses on modern concepts in matrix theory, generalising the standard concept of probabilistic independence to non-commuting random variables.

Rohr et al. devised a conceptual approach to study interactions between species that emphasizes the role of network structure (see the Perspective by Pawar). Using the example of mutualistic networks of communities of plants and their pollinator species, they show how the structure of networks can determine the persistence of the interactions. Network structures and architectures observed in nature intrinsically match the most stable solution. This approach has promise for application to questions of ecological community stability under global change. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1253497; see also p. 383 In ecology, structural stability influences the range of perturbations mutualistic networks can withstand. [Also see Perspective by Pawar] In theoretical ecology, traditional studies based on dynamical stability and numerical simulations have not found a unified answer to the effect of network architecture on community persistence. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework based on the concept of structural stability to explain such a disparity of results. We investigated the range of conditions necessary for the stable coexistence of all species in mutualistic systems. We show that the apparently contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies arise as a consequence of overseeing either the necessary conditions for persistence or its dependence on model parameterization. We show that observed network architectures maximize the range of conditions for species coexistence. We discuss the applicability of structural stability to study other types of interspecific interactions.}

To provide experiential learning opportunities, a simulated patient (SP) program using clinical scenarios was developed. We aimed to design the scenarios to reflect communication demands that student clinicians commonly encounter, that integrated process and content, and which students would perceive as authentic and relevant. Scenarios were based on data from focus groups with recent graduates and interviews with clinic tutors. The scenarios combined content (e.g. medical history) and process (e.g. questioning and relationship skills) at a level suitable for junior students. Students evaluated scenario-based materials and SP activities in a survey comprising Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Students rated the materials and SP activities positively; open-ended comments supported the ratings. Scenario-based materials and activities based on student-clinicians' experiences, were perceived as relevant, realistic, and useful for learning. A curriculum designed on Calgary-Cambridge principles helped address student learning needs at particular stages of their program.},

  abstract   = {In the 70's, Robert May demonstrated that complexity creates instability in generic models of ecological networks having random interaction matrices A. Similar random matrix models have since been applied in many disciplines. Central to assessing stability is the ``circular law'' since it describes the eigenvalue distribution for an important class of random matrices A. However, despite widespread adoption, the ``circular law'' does not apply for ecological systems in which density-dependence operates (i.e., where a species growth is determined by its density). Instead one needs to study the far more complicated eigenvalue distribution of the community matrix S\,=\,DA, where D is a diagonal matrix of population equilibrium values. Here we obtain this eigenvalue distribution. We show that if the random matrix A is locally stable, the community matrix S\,=\,DA will also be locally stable, providing the system is feasible (i.e., all species have positive equilibria D\,{$>$}\,0). This helps explain why, unusually, nearly all feasible systems studied here are locally stable. Large complex systems may thus be even more fragile than May predicted, given the difficulty of assembling a feasible system. It was also found that the degree of stability, or resilience of a system, depended on the minimum equilibrium population.},
