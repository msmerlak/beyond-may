Lines of research that should blend nicely in one argument, with consistent notation, scaling, etc:

- Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, phase diagrams: Bunin 2017: Ecological communities with Lotka-Volterra dynamics
- May-type arguments: see eg Stone 2018: The feasibility and stability of large complex biological networks: a random matrix approach
- Spin glasses and replicas: Biroli, Altieri PRL; see also this recent paper by Urbani (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01899.pdf)

Can we say something about secondary exctinction, eg repeat Emary, Evans 2021? (Can a complex ecosystem survive the loss of a large fraction of its species? A random matrix theory of secondary extinction)
